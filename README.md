# GRE Word Reviewer with Voice Assistance

This README is a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and customizing the GRE Word Reviewer Python program. I came up with this code when I was frustrated during the word reviewing process in my GRE Exam. The program is designed to help users enhance their vocabulary memorization by combining text-to-speech (TTS), interactive input, and progress tracking. It is particularly useful for GRE preparation but can be adapted for any vocabulary-building purpose. Below, weâ€™ll walk through **how the code works**, **how to use it**, and **how to customize it** to suit your needs.

---

## Overview of the Code

The program is divided into multiple functional sections, each serving a specific purpose. This section explains what each part of the code does, how it works, and how you can modify it.

---

### 1. **Imports**

```python
import pyttsx3
import time
import keyboard  
import csv
import random
import pyperclip
```

- **`pyttsx3`**: A text-to-speech conversion library that allows the program to "speak" words aloud.
- **`time`**: Used to introduce sleep delays for smoother operation and prevent repeated key detections.
- **`keyboard`**: Handles keyboard input for interactive word review.
- **`csv`**: Enables reading and writing from/to CSV files to manage word lists.
- **`random`**: Used to shuffle the word list for randomization.
- **`pyperclip`**: Copies the current word to the clipboard for quick access.

> **How to Customize:**  
   - If you donâ€™t need clipboard integration, you can remove the `pyperclip` import and comment out its usage in the code.
   - If you want to add more libraries (e.g., for GUI or API integration), you can add them here.

### 2. **`read_words()` Function**

```python
def read_words(words, original_csv_path, new_csv_path):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()

    # Change the voice (female or male)
    voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
    engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  # use voices[0].id for male

    # Adjusting the rate and volume
    engine.setProperty('rate', 120)   # Speed of speech
    engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume level (0.0 to 1.0)
    
    n = 0
    words = random.sample(words, len(words))  # Shuffle the word list
    
    for word in words: 
        n += 1
        print(f"{n} Word: {word}")
        engine.say(word)
        engine.runAndWait()
        pyperclip.copy(word)  # Copy the word to the clipboard

        while True:
            if keyboard.is_pressed('+'):  # Mark as memorized
                add_word_to_new_csv(word, new_csv_path)  # Move to new CSV
                remove_word_from_csv(word, original_csv_path)  # Remove from original CSV
                time.sleep(0.1)  # Prevent multiple key detections
                break
            elif keyboard.is_pressed('-'):  # Skip the word
                time.sleep(0.1)
                break
```

#### **What It Does:**
- Initializes the **text-to-speech engine** (`pyttsx3`) and sets its properties (voice, rate, volume).
- Shuffles the list of words to ensure random order.
- Iterates through the words, displaying them on the screen, speaking them aloud, and copying each to the clipboard.
- Waits for user input (`+` or `-`) to determine whether the word is memorized or skipped:
  - **`+`**: Moves the word to the "memorized" CSV and removes it from the original list.
  - **`-`**: Skips the word, leaving it in the original list for future review.

#### **How to Customize:**
1. **Change Voice**:
   - The program uses `voices[0].id` (default male voice). To switch to female or another available voice:
     ```python
     engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # Change the index to test other voices
     ```

2. **Adjust Speed and Volume**:
   - To change the speed of speech:
     ```python
     engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Increase for faster speech
     ```
   - To adjust volume:
     ```python
     engine.setProperty('volume', 0.8)  # Set between 0.0 and 1.0
     ```

3. **Change Key Bindings**:
   - To use different keys instead of `+` and `-`:
     ```python
     if keyboard.is_pressed('your_new_key'):  # Replace 'your_new_key' with your preferred key
     ```

---

### 3. **`read_words_from_csv()` Function**

```python
def read_words_from_csv(file_path):
    words = []
    with open(file_path, newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            words.append(row[0])  # Extract the first column (word)
    return words
```

#### **What It Does:**
- Reads all words from the provided CSV file (e.g., `old.csv`) and returns them as a list.

#### **How to Customize:**
- Ensure your CSV file contains only one word per row in the first column.
- If your file has additional columns (e.g., definitions), you can modify the code to extract those too:
  ```python
  for row in reader:
      words.append((row[0], row[1]))  # Extract word and definition
  ```

---

### 4. **`remove_word_from_csv()` Function**

```python
def remove_word_from_csv(word, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        words = list(reader)
    
    words = [row for row in words if row[0] != word]
    
    with open(file_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        writer.writerows(words)
```

#### **What It Does:**
- Removes a specific word from the original CSV file.

#### **How to Customize:**
- You can modify this function to log removed words or create a backup of the CSV file before editing.

---

### 5. **`add_word_to_new_csv()` Function**

```python
def add_word_to_new_csv(word, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        writer.writerow([word])
```

#### **What It Does:**
- Appends the memorized word to the new CSV file (e.g., `memorized.csv`).

#### **How to Customize:**
- If you want to include additional data (e.g., timestamp), modify the function:
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime
  writer.writerow([word, datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')])
  ```

---

### 6. **Main Program Execution**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_csv_path = 'C:/Users/win10/OneDrive/Desktop/old.csv'
    new_csv_path = 'C:/Users/win10/OneDrive/Desktop/memorized.csv'
    
    words = read_words_from_csv(original_csv_path)
    read_words(words, original_csv_path, new_csv_path)
```

#### **What It Does:**
- Defines file paths for the original and memorized word lists.
- Reads the words from the original CSV and starts the review process.

#### **How to Customize:**
- Update the file paths to match your system:
  ```python
  original_csv_path = 'path/to/your/old.csv'
  new_csv_path = 'path/to/your/memorized.csv'
  ```

---

## How to Use the Program

1. **Prepare Your Word Lists**:
   - Create a CSV file (`old.csv`) with one word per row.
   - Optionally, create an empty CSV file (`memorized.csv`) for storing memorized words.

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```
   python gre_word_reviewer.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the Program**:
   - **`+`**: Mark a word as memorized.
   - **`-`**: Skip the word.

4. **Check Your Progress**:
   - Open `memorized.csv` to see the words you've mastered.
   - Open `old.csv` to review the remaining words.
